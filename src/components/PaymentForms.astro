        <p>
          Even after launch, some clients of our customers either still
          preferred the paper form or have a distrust of digital payment
          platforms. Therefore, our customers started to submit payments to
          themselves on behalf of their clients. This resulted in the birth of
          another feature: "Pay on Behalf".
