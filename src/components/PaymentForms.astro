            features we should add to the payment forms for our users after
            launch of the MVP. Using a decision tree helped evaluate priorities.

          Even after launch, some clients of our customers either still
          preferred the traditional paper form because they have a distrust of
          digital payment platforms . Therefore, our customers started to submit
          payments to themselves on behalf of their clients. This resulted in
          the birth of another feature: "Pay on Behalf".
